```BASH
php artisan preset bue

Just say:

```BASH
composer dump-autoload
```

# About Buefy

Buefy is cool stuff, it's *Lightweight UI components for **Vue.js** based on **Bulma***. Take a look in documentation to find out what's what. You have to learn, use this miracle, because it's either easy or beautiful, **Bulma** is cool, but **Buefy** is more, because it makes **Bulma** *UI Components* more dynamic. Especially respect to [**Jeremy Thomas**](https://github.com/jgthms) for **Bulma** and thanks to *maintainers* of **Buefy** for **Buefy** itself

# Contributing

It will be nice if you contribute to the project, I'll be happy, all of us gonna be happy. Only together we can build more than something, more powerful tools. If you have *idea* or you found the bug, or you just know how to simplify the code, I'll check out your **PRs** :cat2:

*Thanks for attention, with respect Mr. CaT*
